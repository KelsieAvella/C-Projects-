# C-Projects-
A collection of various programs I've worked on or created. 

Greeting Program (main.cpp) - This program simply outputs a greeting from me to the user! It is one of the first programs I ever created. Although it is not very complicated, it's meaningful to me because it shows how much I have improved in my knowledge of c++. 

Wind Chill Program (wind.cpp) - This program prompts the user for a temperature and then a wind speed. The program then and validates the numbers, If the user enters an invalid number,the user is again propmted for a value that will meet the requirements. This process will repeat until the user enters valid data. Once the numbers are accepted the program then outputs to the user what the windchill would be based on what the user entered. 

Mad Lib Program (madlib.cpp) - This program prompts the user for a number of nouns, verbs, adjectives, numbers, etc. It then generates a story by placing the user's inputs into a short pre written story. Although the outline of the story is the same, depending on the user's input their are multiple different possibilities of stories that can be created.
